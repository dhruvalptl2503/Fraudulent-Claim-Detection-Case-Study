**Overview**

Global Insure, an insurance company processing thousands of claims annually, faces significant financial losses due to fraudulent claims. The current manual fraud detection process is inefficient and often detects fraud too late. This project aims to enhance fraud detection by leveraging historical claim data and customer profiles to build a predictive model that classifies insurance claims as either fraudulent or legitimate. By identifying patterns and key indicators of fraud early in the approval process, the model helps minimize financial losses and optimize claims handling.


**Goal**

The primary goal is to develop a data-driven solution that:

    Analyzes historical claim data to detect patterns indicative of fraudulent claims.
    Identifies the most predictive features of fraudulent behavior.
    Predicts the likelihood of fraud for incoming claims based on past data.
    Provides actionable insights to improve the fraud detection process.

Ultimately, the model uses features like claim amounts, customer profiles, claim types, and approval times to predict fraudulent claims before they are approved, enabling proactive fraud prevention.

**Project Objectives**

    Pattern Detection: How can we analyze historical claim data to detect patterns that indicate fraudulent claims?
    Feature Importance: Which features are the most predictive of fraudulent behavior?
    Fraud Prediction: Based on past data, can we predict the likelihood of fraud for an incoming claim?
    Process Improvement: What insights can be drawn from the model to improve the fraud detection process?
